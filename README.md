# Customer Classifier & Next Event Probability ðŸ’»

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to classify customers initially in 2 different categories and predict the next event for each customer. We want to predict whether a customer will have an ideal journey through the company's products or not. The ideal journey is apply for credit -> make first purchase -> make down payment -> order ships. 

On the other hand the second model will predict the next event for each customer. The next event can be one out of the 28 (not the final number of total events yet) available events the customer can go through.

The data set that we are working with is the following:
